Part 1: Short answers

Q1. What is a primary key used for? Can you give me an example of a primary key in restaurants collection?

-> A primary key is used to identify one of a kind, specially if 2 names are repeated but mean different things.

Q2. What is the MongoDB equivalent for a MySQL table?

-> MongoDB only uses a table to get the collection of it and gives you the data within the JSON file. MySQL gives tables
and rows which is also another way to input data which works great with joining tables while MongoDB you can input a unique id with its own data making it easier.

Q3. What does CRUD stand for?

--> CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update and Delete. Often used to describe the basic functionality of an app.

Part 2: I will give you MongoDB queries and you must describe what they do.
Q4. db.users.find(
	{firstname: "Randy", lastname: “moss”}
)

-> It finds the user with the name Randy Moss

Q5. db.cars.find(
	{make: "Toyota"},
	{year: 1}
)

*-> Finds Car brands from Toyota of the latest year 

Q6. db.restaurants.update(
	{cuisine: "Japanese"},
	{$set: {address.street: "A new street name"}},
	{multi: true}
)

->Updates all Japanese cuisine to a new street address


Part 3: Use the Restaurants collection to create a query that satisfies the question.

Q7. Find all of the restaurants that have a cuisine of “Jewish/Kosher”

-> db.restaurants.find( {"cuisine": "Jewish/Kosher"}, {"cusine": 1, "name": 1, "_id": 1} ).pretty();

Q8.  Count how many restaurants have a cuisine of “Jewish/Kosher”

--> db.restaurants.find( {"cuisine": {$eq:"Jewish/Kosher"}} ).count();
    316

Q9. Update the address field for the restaurant that has a restaurant_id of "30075445" to be the following:

"address": {
                "building": "10000",
                "coord": [
                        -50,
                        2
                ],
                "street": "Other street",
                "zipcode": "99999"
        }

-> db.restaurants.find( {"restaurant_id": "30075445"}, {$set: {"address": "building": "1000", "coord": [-50,2], "street": "Other street", "zipcode": "99999"}}, {upsert:true} );
